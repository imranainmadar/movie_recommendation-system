The system aims to suggest movies to users based on their preferences and viewing history.

Features:
Content-Based Filtering: Recommends movies similar to those the user has rated highly.

Collaborative Filtering: Suggests movies based on the preferences of similar users.

User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive interface for users to get recommendations.

Techologies used:

Python: The primary programming language for the project.
Machine Learning: Utilized for developing the recommendation algorithms.
Pandas, NumPy: For data manipulation and analysis.
Scikit-Learn: For implementing machine learningÂ models.
